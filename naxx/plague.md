Get yer dancin' shoes on. No dying to slime!

4 "Zones" on the floor: 3 will explode and 1 will be safe, in a pattern.

PHASE 1
All ranged/healers on platform. (boss Manage Burns melee)
{tank}/Melee{dps} on ground with boss.
 - Stay with {star}
Dance pattern is slow in this phase.

3 People will be randomly TP'ed to gauntlet room. Fight back to room. RE-ENTER WHEN DANCE GETS TO DOOR

PHASE 2
Boss TP's to platform. Entire raid down to the floor.
 - STAY WITH {star} (but ideally don't rely on that and follow the pattern)
 Dance pattern is quick! If you stop moving or fall behind, you WILL die!
